#!/usr/bin/env python3
# • Create a program called play_with_arrays.py.
# • This program should be executable.
# • First, define an array of numbers.
# • Then, iterate over this array and build a new array by adding 2 to each value of
# the original array.
# • You should have two arrays in your program: the original array and the new array
# you created.
# • Finally, display both arrays on the screen.
# • For example, if your original array is [2, 8, 9, 48, 8, 22, -12, 2], you should have the
# following output:

def main():
    my_array = [2, 8, 9, 48, 8, 22, -12, 2]
    print(my_array)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
