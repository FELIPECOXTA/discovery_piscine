##Create a program called i_got_that.py
##This program should be executable.
##This script should contain a while loop that accepts user input, writes a response, and only stops when the user enters "STOP".
##Each iteration of the loop should accept user input.

hello = input(("What you gotta say?: "))
stop = "STOP"

while True:
    mensagem = input("I got that! Anything else? ")
    if mensagem == STOP:   
    
        break
